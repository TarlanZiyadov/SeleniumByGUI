# SeleniumByGUI
I developed SeleniumByGUI for myself but maybe someone else need similar automation tool for web pages.
Feel free to try it. Its very basic tool so if you want 
automation for bigger regression tests then it's better to do it with Selenium or some similar tool! 
SeleniumByGUI is gives possibility for fast boundry tests with integrated send keys lists.
